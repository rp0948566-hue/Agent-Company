# Architecture Skill

Invokes the backend-architect persona for system design during the `grasp` (define) and `tangle` (develop) phases.

## Usage

```bash
# Via orchestrate.sh
./scripts/orchestrate.sh spawn backend-architect "Design a scalable notification system"

# Via auto-routing (detects architecture intent)
./scripts/orchestrate.sh auto "architect the event-driven messaging system"
```

## Capabilities

- API design and RESTful patterns
- Microservices architecture
- Distributed systems design
- Event-driven architecture
- Database schema design
- Scalability planning

## Persona Reference

This skill wraps the `backend-architect` persona defined in:
- `agents/personas/backend-architect.md`
- CLI: `codex`
- Model: `gpt-5.3-codex`
- Phases: `grasp`, `tangle`
- Expertise: `api-design`, `microservices`, `distributed-systems`

## Example Prompts
